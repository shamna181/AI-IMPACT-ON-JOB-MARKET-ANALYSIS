A multi-tool analysis of AI’s impact on the job market across industries, education levels, and experience categories using Python, R, and Tableau.

##  Overview

This project analyzes how **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** is influencing the global job market across industries, education levels, and experience categories.  
Using a Kaggle dataset of **30,000 job records**, the study identifies:  

- Job roles most vulnerable to **automation**  
- **Industry-level** differences in AI exposure  
- How **salary, education, and experience** relate to automation risk  
- The link between **AI impact levels** and **projected job demand changes**  


---

##  Key Insights

-  **25%** of jobs are at high risk (>70% automation risk)  
-  High salary does **not** guarantee job safety from automation  
-  AI exposure varies widely by **industry** and **experience level**  
-  Education levels are **evenly distributed**, meaning AI affects all qualification tiers  
-  Some roles are projected to **decline sharply by 2030**, others to **grow rapidly**
